# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution
# AppDocument Constitution

## Core Principles

### [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]
### I. Documentation-First
All features and code changes MUST be accompanied by clear, step-by-step documentation. Documentation MUST be written for entry-level IT audiences, using plain language and examples. Rationale: Ensures accessibility and maintainability for all team members.

### [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]
### II. Code Readability & Simplicity
Code MUST be easy to read, well-commented, and follow consistent formatting. Complex logic MUST be broken into simple, reusable functions. Rationale: Reduces onboarding time and error rates for new developers.

### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]
### III. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All new code MUST include tests before implementation. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is strictly enforced. Rationale: Guarantees reliability and confidence in code changes.

### [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]
### IV. Workflow Transparency
All code workflows (development, review, deployment) MUST be documented and visible to all contributors. Rationale: Promotes collaboration and reduces bottlenecks.

### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]
### V. Business Logic Clarity
Business logic MUST be separated from infrastructure code and clearly explained in documentation. Rationale: Ensures that application behavior is understandable and modifiable by entry-level IT staff.

## [SECTION_2_NAME]
## Additional Constraints
All code MUST comply with organizational security standards and performance requirements. Technology stack choices MUST be documented and justified for each project.

## [SECTION_3_NAME]
## Development Workflow
Code reviews are mandatory for all changes. Each change MUST pass all tests and documentation checks before merging. Deployment approval requires sign-off from at least one senior developer.

## Governance
## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, team approval, and a migration plan. All PRs and reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Use README.md for runtime development guidance.
