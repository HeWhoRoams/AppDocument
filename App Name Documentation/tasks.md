# Documentation Gap Tasks

For each missing, incomplete, or unclear element in the documentation, complete the following atomic tasks to search the codebase and supporting documentation for the required information. Mark each task as complete once the documentation is updated. If information cannot be found, mark the task as blocked and request human input.

<!-- Example tasks below. Replace/add as needed based on actual gap analysis. -->

- [ ] Find and document the definition of 'CustomerID' in 'data dictionary.csv' by searching the codebase.
- [ ] Search for integration endpoints in codebase and update 'Integrations.md' with details.
- [ ] Review project documentation for stakeholder references and update 'Stakeholders.md'.
- [ ] Locate usage and description of 'OrderDate' in code and add to 'data dictionary.csv'.
- [ ] Identify missing summary information in 'Summary.md' and fill in from available docs.

**Note:** Add more tasks as gaps are identified. Each task should be atomic, actionable, and completable.
